General priorities
	• Capturing 2+ checkers
	• Move resulting in a king
	• Capturing a checker 
	• Sacrificing a checker to capture a checker
	• Moving checker to empty space
	• Moving checker into position where it will be captured
	• Moving a king into a position where it will be captured
	
Other Trends
	Priority:
		• Pieces closer to opposite end of board have more priority (except for kings)
		• Moving a king has more priority than a normal piece
	Utility:
		• Moving piece towards enemy checker more utility than moving away
		• Moving a piece farther from the middle has more utility
		• Capturing a king has more utility than capturing a normal piece
		
		
Possible weights to consider:
	• LosingChecker: -1
	• Losing king: -2
	• XIndex = ?
		∙ utility increases as piece moves farther from center
	• YIndex = ?
		∙ utility increases as piece moves closer to opposite side
			∙ Doesn't apply to kings 
	• CapturingChecker = 1
	• CapturingKing = 3
